# Digital Design Unit

DDU regards the fusion of creative work, computational technology and interdisciplinary research as the key to mastering the manifold challenges of our time.

The Digital Design Unit (DDU) is a department in the Faculty of Architecture at the TU Darmstadt. DDU reconstructs how mankind has been tirelessly developing architecture for 4000 years and pursues the goal of making our built environment more diverse, resource-saving and sustainable.

DDU, as an integral part of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, is a place where design, research, science, engineering and critical thinking come together to rethink design and materialisation.
